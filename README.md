##### Random Decision

Tiny app to use the random choice, so I thought in just the simple option to let the random decide.

I used a little <font color="yellow">** Javascript **</font> code, trying to be clean. And then HTML and CSS, trying to be clear in showing what this app can solve for a user.
From ** HTML ** I placed the favicon at this web page. I used the Open Graph Protocol, I consider key, when sharing the link for its presentation. And then the mobile friendly metas. The body of this HTML is quite simple.
I share the idea of less distractions on the web get better results for the user, in this case.

About the ** CSS **, I tried to choose some colors and shapes that let the user go directly their main purpose. I took few colors not to disturb the user view a lot.
